# Network Overview

The Albion University Campus Network is designed to support two geographically separated campuses with multiple buildings and faculties.

The main campus hosts administrative departments, academic faculties, student laboratories, and internal servers.  
The smaller campus supports the Faculty of Health and Sciences with separate staff and student networks.

The network design emphasizes segmentation, scalability, and secure communication using VLANs and dynamic routing.
