# Routing Design

Dynamic routing within the internal university network is implemented using RIPv2.

RIPv2 was selected to:
- Simplify routing configuration
- Support subnetted networks
- Enable automatic route advertisement between internal routers

Static routing is used to reach the external cloud-based email server to maintain controlled and predictable external connectivity.
