# Topology Design

## Hierarchical Design Model
The network follows a hierarchical design model:

- Core Layer: High-speed switching, routing, and redundancy
- Distribution Layer: Inter-VLAN routing and policy enforcement
- Access Layer: End-user connectivity

## Redundancy
- Dual ISP connections
- Dual firewalls
- Dual core switches
- EtherChannel links
- HSRP virtual gateways

This ensures no single point of failure.
