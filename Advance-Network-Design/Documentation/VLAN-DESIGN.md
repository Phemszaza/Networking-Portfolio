# VLAN Design

Each department is assigned a dedicated VLAN to ensure security, traffic separation, and scalability.

- VLANs prevent unnecessary broadcast traffic
- Sensitive departments are isolated
- Guest VLAN is logically separated from internal resources

Voice traffic uses dedicated voice VLANs for QoS optimization.
