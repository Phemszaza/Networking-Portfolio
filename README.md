Networking Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of enterprise focused and laboratory based networking projects designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, EVE NG, and GNS3.
The portfolio demonstrates practical understanding of enterprise network design, routing, redundancy, segmentation, and core networking services using Cisco IOS based devices.

The projects reflect real world scenarios commonly found in corporate, campus, and banking environments, with emphasis on scalability, availability, and structured network architecture.
