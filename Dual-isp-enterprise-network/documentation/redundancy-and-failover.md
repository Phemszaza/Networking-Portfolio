# Redundancy and Failover

## Core Redundancy
Two core switches provide redundant routing paths.

## ISP Redundancy
Two edge routers provide dual Internet connectivity.

## Failover Behavior
If one ISP fails, traffic is routed automatically through the remaining ISP.

## Limitations
No NAT state synchronization is implemented.
