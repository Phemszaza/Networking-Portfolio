# Dual ISP Enterprise Network (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a resilient enterprise network design using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The network is built with redundancy, dynamic routing, VLAN segmentation, and NAT for internet access.

## Key Features
- Dual ISP connectivity (ISP-1 and ISP-2)
- OSPF routing for internal network communication
- NAT overload on edge routers
- Core, Distribution, and Access layer design
- VLAN segmentation (Data, Voice, Guest, Management)
- DHCP for end devices
- High availability and fault tolerance

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- OSPF
- NAT (PAT)
- VLANs & Trunking
- DHCP
- Layer 3 Switching

## How to Use
1. Download the `DUAL_ISP_NETWORKS.pkt` file
2. Open it with **Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2 or higher recommended)**
3. Use Simulation Mode to observe routing, NAT, and failover behavior
