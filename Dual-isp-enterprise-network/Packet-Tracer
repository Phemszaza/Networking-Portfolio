# Dual ISP Enterprise Network (Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This project simulates a redundant enterprise network using two ISPs.
The design includes Core, Distribution, and Access layers with OSPF,
NAT, VLAN segmentation, and dual-edge routers for redundancy.

## Features
- Dual ISP connectivity (ISP-1 and ISP-2)
- OSPF routing in the internal network
- NAT on edge routers
- VLANs for Admin, Finance, Corp, Guest, Voice
- Redundant Core and Distribution switches

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS (3560, 2960, ISR routers)

## Status
✔ Internal routing working  
✔ NAT working  
✔ Both ISPs reachable (with load sharing behavior)
